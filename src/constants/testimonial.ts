He not only solves complex backend issues and handles Web3 contract integrations with remarkable speed, but also maintains a level of professionalism that’s rare these days. His rates are fair, and he doesn’t take advantage of unexpected challenges to increase the price, something many developers do. What impresses me the most is that Tadashi is doing the work of three people on his own, and delivering exceptional quality. He’s definitely a great asset to our project.",
